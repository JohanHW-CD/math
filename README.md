Math problems I solved with numerical methods

Estimates the probability of achieving a winning streak in a binomial game, measures execution time, then plots it. The classical description is exponential, and this solution does it dynamically to make it O(logn). In practise, I only manage to show the early parts of the logn so it looks O(n)
